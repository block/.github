# Block Open Source Security Policy

Block recognizes the important contributions our open source community makes. We welcome 
contributions, including any bug fixes or vulnerabilities that you find. We encourage you to privately 
report it in the repository’s `Security` tab -> `Report a vulnerability`. Block Open Source is 
exploring a bug bounty reward program to further engage our open source community in 
enhancing security and resilience. 

Please see [Privately reporting a security vulnerability](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing-information-about-vulnerabilities/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability#privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability) for more information.

## Scope
Projects hosted in the [`block` GitHub organization](https://github.com/block).

## Disclosure Procedures

We do not publicly disclose vulnerabilities by default. We take the security of our services very seriously and 
monitor their use for indications of a malicious attack. In order to distinguish legitimate security research 
from malicious attacks against our services, we promise not to bring legal action against researchers who:

* Share with us the full details of any problem found.
* Do not disclose the issue to others until we’ve had a reasonable time to address it and disclosure has been approved by us.
* Do not intentionally harm the experience or usefulness of the service to others.
* Never attempt to view, modify, access, disclose, exfiltrate, use or damage data belonging to Block, its customers, or others.
* Do not attempt a denial-of-service attack.
* Do not perform any research or testing in violation of the law.
